# sample-project

> A sample project demonstrating the results of installing with [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm)

Notes:

* the [.pnpm-store](.pnpm-store) folder is installed in the home directory by default.
To have it in the example, the approppriate config value is rewritten in [.npmrc](.npmrc).
